# Talis Aspire integration with Blackboard Learn

Based on the Original Talis Aspire B2 plugin, and with modifications by Simon Booth of Stirling University.

This plugin is very simple in it's operation.  If you are looking for a more full featured integration between Blackboard and Talis Aspire, then you are advised to take a look at our [Learning Tool Interoperability (LTI) integration](http://knowledge.talis.com/articles/tarl-lti/).
