# Talis Aspire integration with Blackboard Learn

This Plugin is an early fork of Simon Booth's Stirling University Talis Aspire Blackboard plugin which is available on Oscelot.

This plugin is very simple in it's operation.  

* it provides a course tool which can add a link to Talis Aspire Reading Lists.
* it provides a module panel that gives an overview of all reading lists available for the user's emrolled modules

There is no upgrade/migration path from the Oscelot version of the block to this version of the block.  Installation of this block is treated as a new installation in Blackboard.

Released versions are:

* [1.0.7.3](https://github.com/talis/aspire-blackboard-learn-integration/releases/tag/v1.0.7.3) - enables support for HTTP redirects to HTTPS which is required when a tenancy is set to force redirect all requests to HTTPS.
* [1.0.7.2](https://github.com/talis/aspire-blackboard-learn-integration/releases/tag/v1.0.7.2) - adds welsh language translations

If you are looking for an integration between Blackboard and Talis Aspire which allows embedding of the list or sections of the list in content areas, then take a look at our [Learning Tool Interoperability (LTI) integration](http://knowledge.talis.com/articles/tarl-lti/).
